Its reddish- brown skin, grainy like the sand beneath their feet, sinks deeply into its slitted eye sockets where a fiery red glow eminates.",

Tenders comprise less than one-third of a band's total poulation, and even they are capable warriors. Consisting mostly of scouts incapable of fighting due to age or infirmity, pregnant females, young children, and the few craftsfolk of the clan, tenders are regarded as second-class citizens. Living in several small, cramped tents within the camp, tenders live squalid lives compared to the spacious and lavish pavilions used by the scout caste.",
							"Males and females have an equal opportunity to prove themselves worthy of the scout caste. Females with children are relegated to be tenders until their children are old enough to be left with others of the caste, only then may they return to the scout caste. As a result, children are raised by the clan as a whole, being alternatively schooled by different members of the scout caste. These scouts have taken it upon themselves to educate the youngsters in various martial and religious mysteries to ensure they are prepared to choose their career when they come of age."
